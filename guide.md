### 1. Installing the Operating System
### 2. Securing your Raspberry Pi
After installing the raspberry pi operating system, it is time to secure it. The security of your Raspberry Pi is important. Gaps in security leave your Raspberry Pi open to hackers who can then use it without your permission.

####Change your default password
The default username and password is used for every single Raspberry Pi running Raspbian. So, if you can get access to a Raspberry Pi, and these settings have not been changed, you have root access to that Raspberry Pi.

So the first thing to do is change the password. This can be done via the raspi-config application, or from the command line.
    sudo raspi-config
